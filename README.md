## Installation

To install this Tech Blog application a user can go to my
github repo at: https://github.com/Dmelz11/Tech_Blog1.
Then clone the repo into their local folder and from a
code editor such as vscode they could open an integrated terminal
and install the node modules and a .env file. Then it would be ready to run in insomnia or in their browser using http:/localhost.

## Credits

This challenge is very similar to the group project #2 that I just completed with my Team mates Savannah Williams and Tasneem Halim, and although I didn't receive any direct colaboration on this challange I feel it is appropriate to mention that I learned some pertinent skills that apply directly to this challenge from my work with Savannah and Tasneem.
That being said, during the project I had my hand in the entire application, except the css, which I've done now in this application.
I resourced the class documentation and recordings as needed for examples.
